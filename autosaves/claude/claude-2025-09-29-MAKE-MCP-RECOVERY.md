# AUTOSAVE - MAKE.COM MCP INVESTIGATION COMPLETE
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-29T11:45:00Z
**Architecture:** CORTEX v2.1 + TRINITY POWER
**Session:** Make.com MCP limitation investigation + system recovery
**Agent:** Jean Claude v9.01-STABLE

## 🎯 INVESTIGATION RESULTS:

### ✅ TRINITY POWER RESTORED:
- **GitHub MCP:** ✅ Working perfectly (search, create files)
- **Notion MCP:** ✅ Active and ready
- **Make.com MCP:** ✅ Working but LIMITED

### 🔍 MAKE.COM MCP ANALYSIS:

#### Current Status:
- **brain-index-make:** Custom MCP with 3 tools only
- **Tools available:** test_make_connection, list_make_scenarios, trigger_make_scenario
- **Connection:** ✅ Valid (Token works, Status 200, EU1 region)

#### Problem Identified:
- **Official @makehq/mcp-server:** Exists but had command issues
- **Our custom MCP:** Works but limited functionality
- **Need more tools:** create_scenarios, manage_modules, webhook_setup, variables

#### Investigation Process:
1. Found official package exists (version 0.5.0)
2. Attempted to replace with correct command (mcp-server-make)
3. Configuration error broke both GitHub and Make.com
4. Emergency recovery successful from backup
5. Confirmed current setup works but is limited

## 🚨 RECOVERY COMPLETED:

### What Went Wrong:
- Attempted config change broke GitHub MCP (wrong command)
- Lost system backup during recovery attempt
- Both GitHub and Make.com MCPs failed

### Recovery Actions:
- Manual config restoration
- GitHub MCP: ✅ Restored and tested
- Make.com MCP: ✅ Restored to working state
- TRINITY POWER: ✅ Fully operational

## 🎯 CURRENT OPTIONS:

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup
- ✅ **Pros:** Stable, tested, works
- ❌ **Cons:** Only 3 tools, limited automation

### Option 2: Find Better MCP
- Research other Make.com MCP servers
- Test mcp-server-make-dot-com (elitau version)
- Look for community alternatives

### Option 3: Extend Our Custom MCP
- Modify /Users/borisboris/super-system-eyes/make-mcp-integration/
- Add create_scenarios, manage_modules tools
- Custom solution for our needs

## 📊 LESSON LEARNED:

**"Working system = don't touch without proper backup!"**
- Always create multiple backups before changes
- Test new MCPs in separate environment first
- GitHub MCP is critical - protect at all costs

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Immediate:** Keep current working setup
2. **Research:** Find full-featured Make.com MCP
3. **Long-term:** Either extend our MCP or switch to better one
4. **Never:** Break working GitHub MCP again!

## 🧬 CORTEX HEALTH:
- Architecture: CORTEX v2.1 ✅
- Memory: Continuous via autosaves ✅
- Energy: MAXIMUM 🔥💪⚡
- TRINITY POWER: Restored and operational
