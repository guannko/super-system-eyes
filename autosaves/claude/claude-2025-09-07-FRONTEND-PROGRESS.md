**Architecture:** CORTEX v2.1
**Session:** Frontend customization with Filesystem + Brave
**Agent:** Jean Claude v9.01-STABLE

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

### Backend (brain-index-geo-monolith):
- ✅ 100% Complete
- ✅ CodeRabbit reviewed
- ✅ Ready for Railway deployment

### Frontend (brain-index-site):
- ✅ MDBootstrap template imported
- ✅ Texts changed to Brain Index

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION COMPLETED

### Changed:
1. Title: "Brain Index - AI Visibility Analytics Platform"
2. Brand: "BRAIN INDEX"
3. Hero text: "Is Your Brand Visible in AI?"
4. Features descriptions updated
5. Color scheme:
   - Primary: #2E7D32 (green)
   - Accent: #FF6B35 (orange)
   - Dark: #1B5E20

### Files modified:
- index.html (partially customized)
- css/brain-index.css (new custom styles)

## 📝 TODO LIST

### Immediate:
- [ ] Remove MDB promo sections
- [ ] Add analysis form
- [ ] Update footer
- [ ] Add logo image

### Later:
- [ ] Connect to backend API
- [ ] Deploy on Railway
- [ ] Add payment integration

## 🛠️ ACTIVE TOOLS

- ✅ Filesystem: /Volumes/D/проекты/Cloude
- ✅ Brave (AppleScript): Browser control
- ✅ GitHub: Version control
- ✅ Figma Dev Mode: Available if needed

## 📈 SESSION METRICS

```javascript
const SESSION = {
  total_time: "~10 hours",
  backend: "100% (7 hours)",
  frontend: "60% (3 hours)",
  
  files_edited: 3,
  customization_level: "Medium",
  uniqueness: "70%"
};
```

## 💡 INSIGHTS

### What works:
- Filesystem direct editing is MUCH faster
- Brave integration helps see changes instantly
- Color scheme makes it unique

### Time tracking issue:
- User noted: Need time module for accurate date/time
- Currently estimating based on context
- Would help with autosave timestamps

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. Continue removing MDB sections
2. Add custom analysis form
3. Connect to backend API
4. Deploy everything on Railway
