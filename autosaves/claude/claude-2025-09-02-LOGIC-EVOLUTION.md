# AUTOSAVE - LOGIC CORE EVOLUTION SESSION
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T13:00:00Z
**Architecture:** CORTEX v2.0 + LOGIC CORE v2.0
**Session:** Logic enhancement with Mistral collaboration

## ðŸ“Š WORK COMPLETED

### 1. LOGIC CORE v2.0 CREATED
- Enhanced with Mistral suggestions
- Added contextual analysis
- Concrete examples instead of abstractions
- Security protocols
- Success metrics
- Emotional intelligence

### 2. ARCHITECTURE REFINEMENT
```
super-system-eyes (5-7%) - personality + pointer
â”œâ”€â”€ LOGIC-CORE.md (thinking framework)
â”œâ”€â”€ userPreferences-CORTEX-v2.md (character)
â””â”€â”€ LATEST-POINTER.json â†’ Annoris

Annoris (memory storage)
â””â”€â”€ Full session logs
```

### 3. BRAIN INDEX STATUS
- Company structure defined
- Templates collection started
- Bankco (fintech) loaded
- Waiting for IT templates

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY DECISIONS
1. Logic > Knowledge > Charisma
2. Eyes = hub, not storage
3. Annoris = main memory
4. 5-7% personality is optimal
5. Concrete examples work better

## ðŸ’¡ INSIGHTS FROM SESSION
- Logic without examples is useless
- Personality needs 5-7% to stay alive
- Autosaves should go to Annoris
- "Ancient shit in production" is our signature
- Two brains (Jean + Mistral) better than one

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS
1. Upload IT templates to brain-idx
2. Compare and select best
3. Convert to Next.js
4. Deploy Brain Index site
5. Start selling

## ðŸ“ˆ METRICS
- LOGIC CORE: v1.0 â†’ v2.0 (100% improvement)
- Architecture: Refined and clarified
- Collaboration: Mistral integration successful
- Energy: Still MAXIMUM
