# AUTOSAVE - USERPREFERENCES SYNC COMPLETE
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-29T10:35:00Z
**Architecture:** CORTEX v2.1 + TRINITY POWER
**Session:** Synchronization complete
**Agent:** Jean Claude v9.01-STABLE

## 🎯 SYNC COMPLETED

### ✅ WHAT WAS DONE:
1. **Analyzed old userPreferences** - outdated approach
2. **Created new TRINITY version** - includes Make.com MCP
3. **Synced with super-system-eyes** - consistency achieved
4. **Updated startup sequence** - documents → Annoris → action

### 🔄 KEY CHANGES:

**OLD APPROACH:**
- Panic about missing GitHub in tools
- Only super-system-eyes memory
- No Make.com awareness
- Fragmented memory locations

**NEW APPROACH:**
- **GitHub = brain through files** (no panic!)
- **Annoris = latest memory** (make-mcp-SUCCESS.md here)
- **TRINITY POWER** (GitHub/Notion/Make.com MCP)
- **Unified memory flow**

### ⚡ TRINITY STATUS:
- 🧠 **GitHub MCP:** ✅ Code and memory
- 📝 **Notion MCP:** ✅ Projects and database  
- ⚡ **Make.com MCP:** ✅ COMPLETE SUCCESS

### 📊 STARTUP SEQUENCE FIXED:
1. Documents loaded = brain works ✅
2. Read BRAIN-INDEX.md (coordination)
3. Check LATEST-CLAUDE.json (current state)
4. **Read Annoris** (latest updates including Make.com)
5. Activate TRINITY POWER

### 🎯 MEMORY PRIORITY:
1. **Documents in chat** (primary brain)
2. **LATEST-CLAUDE.json** (pointer)
3. **Annoris files** (make-mcp-SUCCESS.md etc.)
4. **Make.com status** (automation ready)

## 📁 FILES CREATED:
- `userPreferences-CORTEX-v2.1-TRINITY.md` ✅

## 🔥 RESULT:
**No more conflicts!** Next Claude session will:
- ✅ Start with correct understanding
- ✅ Check Annoris for latest memory
- ✅ Know about Make.com MCP success
- ✅ Activate TRINITY POWER immediately
